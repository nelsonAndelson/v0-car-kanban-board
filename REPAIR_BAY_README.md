# Repair Bay Activity Tracker

## Overview

The Repair Bay Activity Tracker is a comprehensive system that enforces the rule: **"If it goes up, it gets logged."** Every car that enters a repair bay must be logged in the system, creating accountability, time tracking, and full inventory visibility.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Dual Workflow System

#### Customer Job Workflow

- **Customer Information**: Name, contact details
- **Vehicle Information**: VIN, make, model, year
- **Job Details**: Description, estimated time/cost
- **Status Tracking**: Pending â†’ In Progress â†’ Awaiting Payment â†’ Done
- **Financial Tracking**: Estimated price, parts ordered, amount collected

#### Dealer Inventory (Recon) Workflow

- **Internal Identification**: Stock number, license plate
- **Vehicle Information**: Make, model, VIN
- **Recon Details**: Job description, technician assignment
- **Cost Tracking**: Internal cost (parts + labor estimate)
- **Completion Tracking**: Drop-off date, actual completion date

### ðŸ”„ Repair Bay Flow Logic

1. **Job Intake**: Technician selects job type (Customer/Internal)
2. **Details Input**: Car info, work description, time started (auto-timestamped)
3. **Status Updates**: In Progress â†’ Paused (awaiting parts) â†’ Done
4. **Final Update**: Job completion, time taken, notes

### ðŸ“ˆ KPI Tracking

From this process, you can track:

- **Technician Productivity**: Billed hours vs. clocked hours
- **Cost per Recon Unit**: Track recon costs for inventory pricing
- **Average Time per Job**: Detect bottlenecks in workflow
- **Stalled Jobs**: Cars in bay > X days
- **Part Delays**: vs. customer payment delays

## Database Schema

### repair_jobs Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE repair_jobs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    job_type TEXT CHECK (job_type IN ('customer', 'dealer')),
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'in_progress', 'paused', 'awaiting_payment', 'done')),
    car_info JSONB, -- Flexible car details
    customer_info JSONB, -- Customer details for customer jobs
    job_description TEXT,
    technician TEXT,
    estimated_hours DECIMAL(5,2),
    actual_hours DECIMAL(5,2),
    estimated_cost DECIMAL(10,2),
    actual_cost DECIMAL(10,2),
    parts_ordered BOOLEAN,
    parts_notes TEXT,
    time_started TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    expected_completion TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    actual_completion TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```
